# 🚀 DEPLOY TO RAILWAY NOW - Quick Guide

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: The Issue

Railway is using **OLD CODE** that still has `rest_auth`. You need to **push the fixes** we made!

---

## ✅ What We Fixed (All Done Locally)

1. ✅ Updated `requirements.txt` → `dj-rest-auth==5.0.2`
2. ✅ Updated `backend/settings.py` → `dj_rest_auth`
3. ✅ Updated `backend/settings_prod.py` → `dj_rest_auth` ⭐ **Critical!**
4. ✅ Added `rest_framework.authtoken` to both settings files
5. ✅ Fixed imports in `views.py`

---

## 🚀 DEPLOY IN 3 STEPS

### Step 1: Commit Your Changes

Open terminal and run:

```bash
cd dating_api_project

git add .

git commit -m "Fix: Replace deprecated rest_auth with dj-rest-auth for Railway"

git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Wait for Railway Auto-Deploy

1. Go to **Railway Dashboard**
2. Open your **Django service**
3. Watch the **Deployment Logs**
4. Wait for: `✅ Booting worker with pid: X` (NO ERRORS!)

### Step 3: Run Migrations on Railway

Once deployed, go to Railway:
1. Click your service → **"..." menu** → **"Shell"**
2. Run these commands:

```bash
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
```

---

## ✅ SUCCESS INDICATORS

### You'll know it worked when:

1. **No more "rest_auth" errors** in Railway logs
2. **Worker starts successfully**
3. **Health check works:**
   ```bash
   curl https://your-app.railway.app/health/
   ```
   Should return: `{"status": "healthy"}`

---

## 🔥 If You Don't Have Git Set Up Yet

### First Time Git Setup:

```bash
cd dating_api_project

# Initialize git if not already done
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# First commit
git commit -m "Initial commit with OAuth fixes"

# Add your GitHub remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### Then Railway Will Auto-Deploy!

---

## 🎯 ONE-LINE QUICK DEPLOY

If git is already set up:

```bash
cd dating_api_project && git add . && git commit -m "Fix OAuth for Railway" && git push origin main
```

Then watch Railway dashboard for auto-deploy!
